# geog0164-submission
This repository comprises scripts used for data processing and text mining for a submission for a module called GEOG0164: Cartography and Data Visualization. The module is hosted by Dr. James Cheshire, aided by his teaching assistant Nikki Tanu. 

For my submission, I created 5 maps, some of which are complemented by infographics, centred on the topic of paranormal sightings in the United States.
