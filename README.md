# geog0164-submission
This repository comprises scripts used for data processing and text mining for a submission for a module called GEOG0164: Cartography and Data Visualization. The module is hosted by Dr. James Cheshire, aided by his teaching assistant Nikki Tanu. 

For my submission, I created 5 maps, some of which are complemented by infographics, centred on the topic of paranormal sightings in the United States. 

The scripts include:
1. Bears coding.R -  data processing involved prior to creating a bivariate choropleth map of black bear population and bigfoot sightings 
2. Haunted places coding.R - text mining to investigate the most commonly used adjective in each state to describe haunted places
3. Text Only (for word count).txt - main text (excluding footnotes) of my submission writeup 
4. UFO text analysis.R - data processing and text mining to investigate the most commonly reported shapes and colours of UFOs 

All mapmaking was performed directly in QGIS.
